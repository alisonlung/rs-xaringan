  abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185km swath with a 30m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100m resolution over a 185km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite “Landsat 8” following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.},

  abstract = {Landsat 8, originally known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) partnership that continues the legacy of continuous moderate resolution observations started in 1972. The conception of LDCM to the reality of Landsat 8 followed an arduous path extending over nearly 13years, but the successful launch on February 11, 2013 ensures the continuity of the unparalleled Landsat record. The USGS took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed LCDM to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, LDCM promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-daycycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years.}

  abstract = {Although detailed spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is crucial for numerous applications, current global soil moisture products generally have low spatial resolutions (25–50 km), which largely limit their application at local scales. In this study, we developed a high-resolution soil moisture retrieval framework based on ensemble learning by integrating Landsat 8 optical and thermal observations with multi-source datasets, including in-situ measurements from 1,154 stations in the International Soil Moisture Network, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product, the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, and auxiliary datasets (terrain, soil texture, and precipitation). Two widely used ensemble learning models were explored and compared using ten-fold cross-validation. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model performed slightly better than the random forest (RF) model, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.047 m3/m3 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.952, respectively. Further validation using data from four independent soil moisture networks demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of the XGBoost model was comparable to the SMAP soil moisture product, but with a much higher spatial resolution. The model was finally used to map soil moisture over the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau, which is especially sensitive to climate change, from May to September of 2015. The comparison between our fine-scale soil moisture map at 30 m resolution and the coarse-scale SMAP soil moisture product (36 km) revealed high spatial consistency. These results suggest that there is potential to generate accurate soil moisture products globally at 30 m spatial resolution from the long-term Landsat archive. This finding has practical implications in scenarios requiring fine-scale soil moisture maps, such as climate change and permafrost modeling, hydrological and land surface modeling, and agriculture monitoring.},

  abstract = {The United States (U.S.) federal government provides imagery obtained by federally funded Earth Observation satellites typically at no cost. For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program. Here, we describe important aspects of the Landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy.},

abstract = {AbstractAtmospheric water vapor (wv) is required for the accurate retrieval of the land surface temperature from remote sensing data and other applications. This work aims to estimate wv from Landsat 8 Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) images using a new modified split-window covariance-variance ratio (MSWCVR) method on the basis of the brightness temperatures of two thermal infrared bands. Results show that the MSWCVR method can theoretically retrieve wv with an accuracy better than 0.3 g/cm2 for dry atmosphere (wv <2 g/cm2) conditions and better than 0.5 g/cm2 for wet atmosphere conditions. The method was applied at different locations with dry and moist atmospheres and was validated at 42 ground sites using AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) ground-measured data and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products. The results show that the retrieved wv from the TIRS data is highly correlated with the wv of AERONET and MODIS but is generally larger. This difference was probably attributed to the uncertainty of radiometric calibration and stray light coming outside from field of view of TIRS instrument in the current images. Consequently, the data quality and radiometric calibration of the TIRS data should be improved in the future.},

abstract = {Invasive plant species are major threats to biodiversity. They can be identified and monitored by means of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. This study aimed to test the potential of multiple very high-resolution (VHR) optical multispectral and stereo imageries (VHRSI) at spatial resolutions of 1.5 and 5mto quantify the presence of the invasive lantana (Lantana camara L.) and predict its distribution at large spatial scale using medium-resolution fractional cover analysis. We created initial training data for fractional cover analysis by classifying smaller extent VHR data (SPOT-6 and RapidEye) along with three dimensional (3D) VHRSI derived digital surface model (DSM) datasets. We modelled the statistical relationship between fractional cover and spectral reflectance for a VHR subset of the study area located in the Himalayan region of India, and finally predicted the fractional cover of lantana based on the spectral reflectance of Landsat-8 imagery of a larger spatial extent. We classified SPOT-6 and RapidEye data and used the outputs as training data to create continuous field layers of Landsat-8 imagery. The area outside the overlapping region was predicted by fractional cover analysis due to the larger extent of Landsat-8 imagery compared with VHR datasets. Results showed clear discrimination of understory lantana from upperstory vegetation with 87.38% (for SPOT-6), and 85.27% (for RapidEye) overall accuracy due to the presence of additional VHRSI derived DSM information. Independent validation for lantana fractional cover estimated root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11.8% (for RapidEye) and 7.22% (for SPOT-6), and R2 values of 0.85 and 0.92 for RapidEye (5 m) and SPOT-6 (1.5 m), respectively. Results suggested an increase in predictive accuracy of lantana within forest areas along with increase in the spatial resolution for the same Landsat-8 imagery. The variance explained at 1.5 m spatial resolution to predict lantana was 64.37%, whereas it decreased by up to 37.96% in the case of 5 m spatial resolution data. This study revealed the high potential of combining small extent VHR and VHRSI-derived 3D optical data with larger extent, freely available satellite data for identification and mapping of invasive species in mountainous forests and remote regions.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional point data acquired by Terrestrial Lidar Scanning (TLS) is used as ground observation in comparisons with fire severity indices computed from Landsat satellite multi-temporal images through Google Earth Engine (GEE). Forest fires are measured by the extent and severity of fire. Current methods of assessing fire severity are limited to on-site visual inspection or the use of satellite and aerial images to quantify severity over larger areas. On the ground, assessment of fire severity is influenced by the observers' knowledge of the local ecosystem and ability to accurately assess several forest structure measurements. The objective of this study is to introduce TLS to validate spectral burned ratios obtained from Landsat images. The spectral change was obtained by an image compositing technique through GEE. The 32 plots were collected using TLS in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. TLS-generated 3D points were converted to voxels and the counted voxels were compared in four height strata. There was a negative linear relationship between spectral indices and counted voxels in the height strata between 1 to 5 m to produce R-2 value of 0.45 and 0.47 for unburned plots and a non-linear relationship in the height strata between 0 to 0.5m for burned plots to produce R-2 value of 0.56 and 0.59. Shrub or stand development was related with the spectral indices at unburned plots, and vegetation recovery in the ground surface was related at burned plots. As TLS systems become more cost efficient and portable, techniques used in this study will be useful to produce objective assessments of structure measurements for fire refugia and ecological response after a fire. TLS is especially useful for the quick ground assessments which are needed for forest fire applications.},
