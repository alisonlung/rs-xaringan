	abstract = {Landsat 8, originally known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission ({LDCM}), is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration ({NASA})-U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) partnership that continues the legacy of continuous moderate resolution observations started in 1972. The conception of {LDCM} to the reality of Landsat 8 followed an arduous path extending over nearly 13years, but the successful launch on February 11, 2013 ensures the continuity of the unparalleled Landsat record. The {USGS} took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed {LCDM} to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, {LDCM} promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-daycycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years.},

	abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ({NASA}) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey ({USGS}) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission ({LDCM}). {NASA} is responsible for building and launching the {LDCM} satellite observatory. {USGS} is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager ({OLI}), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185km swath with a 30m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor ({TIRS}), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100m resolution over a 185km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. {OLI} and {TIRS} will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered {OLI} and {TIRS} data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The {LDCM} development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The {USGS} intends to rename the satellite “Landsat 8” following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.},

	abstract = {Although detailed spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is crucial for numerous applications, current global soil moisture products generally have low spatial resolutions (25–50 km), which largely limit their application at local scales. In this study, we developed a high-resolution soil moisture retrieval framework based on ensemble learning by integrating Landsat 8 optical and thermal observations with multi-source datasets, including in-situ measurements from 1,154 stations in the International Soil Moisture Network, the Soil Moisture Active Passive ({SMAP}) soil moisture product, the {ERA}5-Land reanalysis dataset, and auxiliary datasets (terrain, soil texture, and precipitation). Two widely used ensemble learning models were explored and compared using ten-fold cross-validation. The extreme gradient boosting ({XGBoost}) model performed slightly better than the random forest ({RF}) model, with a root mean square error ({RMSE}) of 0.047 m3/m3 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.952, respectively. Further validation using data from four independent soil moisture networks demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of the {XGBoost} model was comparable to the {SMAP} soil moisture product, but with a much higher spatial resolution. The model was finally used to map soil moisture over the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau, which is especially sensitive to climate change, from May to September of 2015. The comparison between our fine-scale soil moisture map at 30 m resolution and the coarse-scale {SMAP} soil moisture product (36 km) revealed high spatial consistency. These results suggest that there is potential to generate accurate soil moisture products globally at 30 m spatial resolution from the long-term Landsat archive. This finding has practical implications in scenarios requiring fine-scale soil moisture maps, such as climate change and permafrost modeling, hydrological and land surface modeling, and agriculture monitoring.},
